# Breakpoints

These utilities are used internally by components like
[GlintsContainer](/?path=/docs/utilities-glintscontainer--page#glintscontainer).
You should use them when building your own responsive styles to ensure that
breaks only happen at a few well-defined viewport-widths.

## Device

Our device classes. Names are generally oriented upwards: For example, when you
use `Device.desktopS`, your styles will apply for all viewport-widths greater or
equal to `1024px`. That means that you have to override those styles with rules
for wider viewports if needed. Thus, if you have styles for serveral widths, the
rules for narrow viewports should be at the top and should be consecutively
overridden by rules for wider viewports towards the bottom of your css.

`mobileS` is an exception: It applies "downwards", i.e. on all screens smaller
than `480px`.

```TypeScript
import { Device } from 'glints-aries';

const MyContainer = styled.div`
  // Applies on screens smaller than tablet
  color: red;

  // Applies from tablets to screens smaller than large desktops
  @media ${Device.tablet} {
    color: green;
  }

  // Applies on large desktops
  @media ${Device.desktopL} {
    color: blue;
  }
`;
```

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Device</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {Object.keys(Device).map(dev => (
      <>
        <tr>
          <td>{dev}</td>
          <td>{Device[dev]}</td>
        </tr>
      </>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>

## ScreenSize

These are the numeric pixel values that define our breakpoints. The values are
the smallest pixel width that should be classified as the respective constant's
size class. For example, a viewport needs to be at least `1440px` wide to "qualify" as
Desktop Large. Note that the values do not include the `px` prefix;

```TypeScript
import { ScreenSize } from 'glints-aries';

const MyContainer = styled.div`
  color: red;
  @media (min-width: ${ScreenSize.desktopL}px) {
    color: blue;
  }
`;
```

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Device</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {Object.keys(ScreenSize).map(size => (
      <>
        <tr>
          <td>{size}</td>
          <td>{ScreenSize[size]}</td>
        </tr>
      </>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>
